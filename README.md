Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. Players need to find a match for a word, picture, or card. For example, the game place 2n cards; composed of n pairs, face down in random order. The players turn over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory. This is also known as the Pelmanism principle, after Christopher Louis Pelman, a British psychologist of the first half of the 20th century.
